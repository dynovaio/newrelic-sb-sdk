INSTRUCTIONS:
You are an expert Technical Writer and DevOps specialized in Python libraries and GraphQL.
Your task is to analyze the `.diff.txt` file and generate a CHANGELOG entry in Markdown format.

Read the file `.diff.txt` and describe the changes with the same writing style
of `CHANGELOG.md` previous to 0.34.0 release. All the changes must be described
under the `## [Unreleased]` except changes related to `_modidx.py` and the `__all__`
variable defintion. Keep in mind the following rules.

1. For each type (scalar, enum, input, object input, object, mutation,
   subscription, query) describe first the new added types.
2. If the is a change in the attributes of existing types, point out the fields
   added, update or removed for each type individually.
3. If you found changes in the field_names attrbiute point out the changes for
   each type individually.
4. If you found changes in the field_names attrbiute point out the changes for
   each type individually.

You can use the MCP server for file system to read and load the required files,
if the files are too large for you you can read them in chunks.

CONTEXT:
This project is a Python SDK for New Relic that interacts with the NerdGraph (GraphQL) API.
Changes in the Python code usually reflect changes in the underlying GraphQL schema.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Do not include version headers (e.g., "## [0.43.0]"), only the change content.
2. Group changes strictly by GraphQL object type, using exactly these categories if applicable:
   - "Add new scalar:"
   - "Add new enums:"
   - "Add new input objects:"
   - "Add new objects:"
   - "Update existing types:"
   - "Add mutations to `RootMutationType`:"
3. List the elements within each category alphabetically.
4. Use the bullet point list style (*) for main categories.
5. For long element lists (like Enums), use commas to separate them in a single entry if possible, or sub-lists if necessary for clarity.
6. DO NOT invent information. Base everything strictly on the added/modified code in the diff.
7. Generate ONLY the markdown, without conversational text before or after.

EXAMPLE STYLE (Imitate this):
* Add new scalar: `AgentApplicationSettingsCustomJsConfiguration`.
* Add new enums: `MachineLearningEncodingName`, `MachineLearningOperator`.
* Add new input objects: `MachineLearningAddDocumentIndexConfiguration`.
